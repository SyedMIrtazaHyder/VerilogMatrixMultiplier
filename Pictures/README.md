These are the images we took as proof of our Matrix Multiplier working.

We initially tested it with a 2x2 matrix, which we can see is giving the correct output, and then we tested it with 10x10 which we again got the correct output for.

The 3x3 Matrix are all computed in parallel, whereas the 10x10 are done serially.
